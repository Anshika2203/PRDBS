Filtered Folder View Toggle in Listing page


Tasks to be done
- Allow switching between consolidated and folder-based view when filters are applied
- Ensure only folders with matching cases ones are rendered, with necessary parents
- Implement folder/consolidated toggle component above the listing


Logic
- The toggle is visible when any filter is applied.
- When enabled, folders containing filtered matched ones are shown with their parent path.
- All folder actions are disabled in filtered view.
- Folder counts should reflect number post-filter

Soft Delete Preview


Problem Statement:
Currently, immediate archived after user confirmation. Some users find this flow too abrupt and risky, especially during bulk actions. There is a need to offer a preview mode before committing to archive.

Feature Description:
Introduce a 'soft delete' preview mode for test case archiving. After users select what to archive, they enter a temporary preview state with a final CTA to confirm.
